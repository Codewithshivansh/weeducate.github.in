            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. vIn ancient India, education was
                imparted and passed on orally rather than in written form. Education was a process that involved three
                steps, first was Shravana (hearing) which is the acquisition of knowledge by listening to the Shrutis.
                The second is Manana (reflection) wherein the students think, analyze and make inferences. Third, is
                NididhyƒÅsana in which the students apply the knowledge in their real life.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">Starting in about 3500 BCE, various writing systems developed in ancient
                civilizations around the world. In Egypt, fully developed hieroglyphs were in use at Abydos as early as
                3400 BCE. The oldest known alphabet was developed in central Egypt around 2000 BCE from a
                hieroglyphic prototype. One hieroglyphic script was used on stone monuments, other cursive scripts
                were used for writing in ink on papyrus, a flexible, paper-like material, made from the stems of
                reeds that grow in marshes and beside rivers such as the River Nile.
                The Phoenician writing system was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script in around the 11th century BC,
                which in turn borrowed ideas from Egyptian hieroglyphics. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">There is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or
                should be. Different places, and at different times, have used educational systems for different
                purposes. The Prussian education system in the 19th century, for example, wanted to turn boys and girls
                into adults who would serve the state's political goals.
                The purpose of education in a given time and place affects who is taught, what is taught, and how the
                education system behaves. For example, in the 21st century, many countries treat education as a
                positional good. In this competitive approach, people want their own students to get a better
                education than other students. </p>
